**MarkDump** is a handy VS Code extension that automatically detects image links in Markdown documents, downloads them, and stores them in an `img` folder within the document's directory. It also renames the images sequentially (e.g., `01.png`, `02.png`, `03.png`) and replaces the original links in the Markdown file with the local paths.

## Features
- Automatically detects image links in Markdown documents (supports HTTP/HTTPS links).
- Downloads images to an `img` folder in the document's directory.
- Renames the images sequentially (e.g., `01.png`, `02.jpg`).
- Replaces the Markdown document's image links with local paths.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- The Markdown file must be saved on disk.

### Steps

   ```
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) to open the Command Palette.

5. The extension will:
   - Download images to an `img` folder in the document's directory.
   - Rename the images sequentially, e.g., `img/01.png`, `img/02.jpg`.
   - Replace the image links in the Markdown document with the local paths, for example:

      â”œâ”€â”€ 01.png
      â”œâ”€â”€ 02.jpg

## Notes
